    = An array is simply a list of other values 
        
        $articles = [
            "First post",
            "Another post",
            "Read this!"
        ];

    = $articles contains 3 string values.
    = There are 2 ways to create an array in PHP:
      = You create the array using [] (square brackets) like the $articles
      = The alternative one is using array function
        
        $articles = array(
            "First post",
            "Another post",
            "Read this!"
        );

13  - Create the $articles and var_dump to see the contents of the array 
    = The value of each of the array is called array element.
      = $articles has 3 elements.
    = You access the array element by indexing using [] operator in their 
      variable's name
        echo $articles[0];          // => First post
        echo $articles[1];          // => Another post,
        ...
14  - var_dump the first element
    = by default, PHP create the index that's a number starting from zero when you creating
      an array.
      = However, you can also manually specify your index. you specify the index like this:
        
        $articles = [
            1 => "First post",
            3 => "Another post",
            "Read this!"
        ];

      = The last part automatically will be continuing the previous element index.
15  - create another array which you manually specify the index and var_dump
      = The index also can specified by string, not a number only.
        = This is called associative array.
          $articles = [
            "first" => "First post",
            "four" => "Another post",
            "Read this!"
          ];
        = The last part automatically will be the first index that's a number
          which on array the index starting from zero.
     = You can only create an Associative array from only two data types:
       integer & string.
     = The index you've created manually on associative array is called key.
16 - create associative array and access it first - last element using var_dump
     = We can shows the all of the elements using loop. so you dont' echoing each of 
       the element of the array one by one.
17 - using foreach loop to echo one by one the element of the array on 13-
18 - using foreach loop to echo one by one the associative arrays 15-
