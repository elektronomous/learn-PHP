1   - Create a file called new-article.php and insert the header.php, footer.php
      make a form inside it.
2   - process the form using the current php file.
      = After you debug the $_POST, you feel that the user input was right you can insert it into
        DATABASE
      = Using the SQL command for inserting:

            INSERT INTO table_name
                VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

      = How many value are going to be inserted is must match how many column inside the table.
      = Or you wanna insert into specific column

            INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2)
                VALUES (value1, value2);
        
      = You wanna insert multiple values into the table:

            INSERT INTO table_name,
                VALUES (value1, value2),
                       (value1, value2),
                       (value1, value2),
                       ......
                       (value1, value2);
      = To avoid sql injection you can use mysqli_escape_string() function

            mysqli_escape_string($connect, $_POST['title"]);
            mysqli_escape_string($connect, $_POST['content']);
      
      = Another way to prevent SQL injection is using the `prepare` statement.

            $sql_query = mysqli_prepare($connect, "SELECT * FROM article WHERE id=?");

      = the `?` is the placeholder, you need to bind something to the placeholder

            mysqli_stmt_bind_param($sql_query, 'i' or 's', $_GET['id']);
      
      = type that you pass to bind_param() could be:
            i for integer
            d for double/flaot
            s for string
            b for variable is a blob and will be sent in packets.
      
      = the number of placeholder in your query must match the number of type you pass.
      = You use mysqli_stmt_execute() to send the command to the database

            if (mysqli_stmt_execute($sql_query)) {
                  echo "inserted id: " . mysqli_insert_id() . "<br />";
            } else {
                  echo mysqli_stmt_error($sql_query);
            }
      
      = Server has a log that you could enable to monitor the command that has been run.
        goto the documentation of your database.
