       = Say that you have a contents, which need to update frequently.
       = you can store the contents to the file and access it later.
       = but operation on a file for reading back the contents is so expensive,
       = we need some security for the contents being read.
       = That's why we need database
       = A database is a structured set of data organized so that it can be easily to
       accessed and updated.

1    - on xampp control panel, start mysql database service
2    - goto localhost/phpmyadmin/
3    - create database called 'cms' with collation 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'
4    - add user account to make this database safe.
       [=] create a priviliges(username and its password) for the database we created:
        = goto priviliges tab
        = below the table, click add user account
              
              [=] username = "elektronomous"
              [=] hostname = Choose local        => since we access this db from this computer
              [=] password = "anythingyoulike"
              [v] grant all access to this db    => means the elektronomous user could do anything to this db

       [=] create a table called `article` with 4 rows
              CREATE TABLE `cms`.`article` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , `title` VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL , `content` TEXT NOT NULL , `published_at` DATE NULL , PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
       
       = when you check A_I(AUTO_INCREMENT) box, you don't need to fill the id, when you insert a data to the table.
       [=] insert a value to the article
              INSERT INTO `article` (`id`, `title`, `content`, `published_at`) VALUES (NULL, 'First post', 'This is my first of many post!', '2022-10-20'), (NULL, 'Second post', 'Another interesting post', '2022-11-01');
       = to create a fast response when you querying sql commands you need to create an index
       to the columns.
       = this avoid sql to scan all the columns.
       = to connect to database, we use mysqli_connect.
5    - create a index.php on www/Section08 directory to practice how to connect to database.
6    - initialize database's host, name, username, and its password and connect to your database
       using mysqli_connect() function.
       = after you connect to your database, you need to check the connection using
       mysqli_connect_error();
7    - using mysqli_connect_error() to find out where's the error occurs
       = if there's no error, you could querying the commands to the database
8    - create a query first and then using mysqli_query to send your query to connected database.
       = you need to check if the query you send is success or failed.
9    - check the status of your query using mysqli_error(). if it's not error you could use to get
       the result using mysqli_fetch_all. the result will be an array.
     - you pass MYSQLI_ASSOC to get the column associative with value.
10   - comment out the mysqli_fetch_all, instead of get all of the array result use mysqli_fetch_assoc
       to get only one array.
     - comment the loop inside the HTML and the fix the if statement
       = the 10 step is for showing only one post. 
       = we can pass query string via URL.
       = https://example.com/page.php?page=2
       = after the ? sign, that's the query string.
         = we can access the value of the query string via $_SERVER key's array.
11   - try to print_r($_SERVER) anywhere on the index.php file so you can see how the $_SERVER
       looks like.
     - print_r($_GET) to look the difference between the $_SERVER
12   - combine the $sql commands with $_GET.
13   - to avoid SQL injection create an if statement.
14   - create a file called database.php to contains the start of the connection to database 
     - remove the 6 - 7 from index.php and article.php
     - using require_once to load the database.php
15   - also remove the header of the html from index.php and article.php
     - put them into a file called header.php
16   - create .htaccess files to deny access to includes folder and its files.
