20 - create a file called index.php
     = everytime you create a variable on PHP side, make sure you create at the top
       of the HTML.
     = say now you have condition statement, you want to mix them with HTML like this:

        <?php
        
        $hour = 12;

        if($hour < 12) {
            echo "Good Morning";
        }else if($hour < 18) {
            echo "Good Afternoon";  
        }else if($hour < 22) {
            echo "Good Evening";
        }

        ?>

     = Do not mix the initialization of the variable with the conditional statement. instead
       create the initialization on top of the HTML code.
21 - initialize your variable on top of your HTML code also move the initialized variable if
     they're still within HTML code.
     = alternative control structure

     <?php
     $hour = 12;
     ?>

     <?php if($hour < 12): ?>
        HTML CODE
     <? endif; ?>

     = this alternative works for while(endwhile;), for(endfor;), foreach(endforeach;), and 
       switch(endswitch;)
