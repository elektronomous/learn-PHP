1   - create form.php on www/Section10 folder
2   - create process_form.php that will process the form.php
      = the form you create on 1- will be the query string called "search"
        with the value that you submitted to on input element

          process_form.php?search=yourValue
        
        this process_form.php is file that handle your query string which is the attribute
        of the <form> element action attribute.
      = if you dont' specify the action, it submitted itself(the query string will send to
        current php file). it redisplays the form.
      = but it's usefull, user can correct erros it has made like missed out filling a form.
3   - commenting out the 2, and create <input> element for username and password.
      = when you don't specify the method to send the submitted data or using get method, 
        the username and password will be shown on the URL bar and by browser, it will be save.
      = get method will send data using the query string.
      = post method will send data seperately from the query string.
4   - try to change the method on <form> element to post method to see how the submitted data
      are sent.
      = when you send data using POST method, the data will be sent to the PHP global variable
        $_POST array.
5   - add the if statement for $_POST inside the process_form.php
6   - create its alternative using $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];
      = when to use GET method:
        = you can bookmark the result since the data you've submitted send with the URL
        = we don't send sensitive data using GET method, because it shows the data on the URL
        = URL has size limit in some browsers, you use get method to limits the size of the data that you want to send.
      = when to use POST method:
        = you can't bookmark the result since the data you've submitted are seperated with the URL
        = when you sending a sensitive data(sql commands, password, username, so on), use this method.
        = There's no size limiting in POST method.
      = the real life of example using GET method is when you send data and the server response back to you as the result
        (search engine, querying something, so on).
      = the real life of example using POST method is when you try to insert/update data within the database or textfile.
