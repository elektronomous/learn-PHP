    ? How Website work
        = A web server is simply a computer that web server software installed.

        = Web server software is a program that delivers our serves file that make up website.
        = Apache we installed has Apache Web Server.
        = Every web server has an address (such as google.com, Yahoo.com, wikipedia.org)

        = By default, the address of web server on our computer is localhost.
        = When web server(software) has running, it sits and waits for request for files.
        = These request is commonly from web browser.
        = Web browser is a program to access a website.
        = When you type the website (htps://localhost/hello.php) to your browser.
        = It request the site from the web server(You computer), the Web server receives your
        request and the requested files are sent back.
        = PHP is programming language that its code we save on our web server(Hello.php)
        = When this code is requested(using browser) the web server executes php code and 
      the result of executing the code are sent to the browser.
        = It's important to notes PHP is run on the web server(our computer), it doesn't run on the
      browser.
2   - Go to the Hello.php and see the additional explanation
3   - Create variable inside Hello.php called message and shows its output.
        = Variables are use to stored information for the program to use.
        = Think variable as the container that hold information or a box contain a thing.
        = You should create a variable name with descriptive(meaningfull) name, so you can ease to access
          later on your program.
        = You can store different data types(String, Numbers, array, Boolean, & so on) into a variable.
        = String are simply a text(sequence of characters) between quotes(").
        = Number that contains the variable can be an integer (whole number with no decimal(.) part)
          and float (the number with decimal(.) part).
        = Integer can be positive or negative
            $myId = 112233;
            $cardNumber = 5009234123434;
            $degreeCelcius = -10;
        = float can be positive or negative too:
            $PHI = 3.14;
            $priceTag = 300.50;
            $taxRage = 10.5;
            $degreeFahrentheit = -20.5;
        = PHP has built-in function called var_dump, you can use this to see the contents of the
      variables
4   - Create a integer variable and float variable.
5   - Using the var_dump function to see the details of all the variable you've created.
        = Boolean value is simply just two values, which is true and false
        = this Boolean is usefull when you controlling flow in your program, what it should do, 
      and decide which code you want to run.
6   - Create a variable which stored Boolean value and show how this variable is used.
        = There is a special value called Null that represent that variable has no value.
7   - Create Null variable & show how null variable used in PHP.
        = You can apply operation like addition, divition, multiplication, substraction, and modulation
      on Number variable type.
8   - Apply all of the operation to Number (integers or float)
        = You can also concatenate string using the dot(.)
9   - Create a string two variable for hello and your name.
    - Concatenate them using . operator
        = Say that your string is sequences of number and you accidently multiply it using 
            $price = "150";
            echo $price * 3;        // => 450: PHP do type juggling/type conversion here
        = Type conversion is use by PHP when necessary, like this.
10  - Create the problem we describe after 9-
        = We have logical operator for Boolean values, which is
        = &&    => AND
        = ||    => OR
        = ===   => EQUALITY
        = !=    => UNEQUALITY
        = !     => NOT
        = XOR
11  - Test Boolean values using logical operator combine with if that we've used on 6-
        = if you want to insert a variable into a string, you can use {} into the double quotes.
          it doesn't work for single quote of string
12  - Shows output using {} to insert variables
