= A class liek blueprint or template
= We can use this template to create object of that class.
= For example:
    = User class
    = You can then create a object user, like Dave user, John user, and so on.

= To create an object from class we  use 'new' keyword followed by the class name
= It's better to create a php file for the class, so it's seperated from the object.
= When you created a file name that's class inside it, you created the name of the file
  as the name of the class you will create.
= Class name begin using Capital Letter.
= Object of a class have certain attributes/properties.
= For example:
    = User object (Dave) has username, and email
= The public keyword specify how the properties/attributes of the object get access.
= If you dont specify the value of the property, it sets to NULL
= You can add the properties via the object you create using the access object operator(->)
  = This impractical because it introduce a bug.
= You can define a function inside the class.
  = It's called method.
  = You define this function as regular function you created.
= There's a special value called $this inside the method you created.
= $this represent the object you currently working on(the object where you calling the method).
= $this is used to access properties inside method or callign another method inside the method.
= There is a method which called automatically when we create an object.
  = This method called __construct used to initialize the properties/attributes inside the class.
