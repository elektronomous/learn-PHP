= When deleting a data from a table we use sql statement:

        DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

= If you dont specify the WHERE clause, the table will be deleted.
= When deleting a data from database, we use POST method. This avoid
  the user to enter a manual id on the query string make the data in the 
  database will be deleted.
= The use of asteriks(*) after SELECT from the database is quite performance issue.
  So get the data that you select by only specify the column you need.
